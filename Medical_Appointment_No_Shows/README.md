# 🏥 Medical Appointment No-Shows Prediction

## 📌 Context
**Repository:** [recodehive/machine-learning-repos](https://github.com/recodehive/machine-learning-repos)  
**PR:** [#1684](https://github.com/recodehive/machine-learning-repos/pull/1684)

This project aims to aggregate various machine learning models. I proposed adding a model to predict whether a patient will show up for their medical appointment.

## 🎯 Objective
To predict `No-show` (Yes/No) based on patient data such as age, gender, scholarship status, and existing conditions (hypertension, diabetes, etc.).

## 🔬 Approach
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling categorical variables and temporal features (ScheduledDay vs. AppointmentDay).
- **Model:** Implemented a classification model (e.g., Random Forest or Logistic Regression) to identify patterns in missed appointments.

## 🚀 Importance
Reducing no-shows is critical for healthcare providers to optimize resource utilization and reduce revenue loss. This model serves as a reference implementation for such predictive analytics.
